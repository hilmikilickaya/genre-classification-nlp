  Music tells us a lot about who we are.  Spotify says you are what you stream. I like music apps and always find it impressive how they make it easier for us to create playlists by the genre. I wanted to know if I could create a classification model with lyrics using Natural Language Processing?
  
## Data
  My dataset contains over five thousand songs and six genres. After plotting songs by genre, I figured that I have an imbalanced class. I decided to remove electronic dance music to have a better model.

## Tf-idf
  I started my cleaning process. I lowercase the text and then tokenize, strip out undesirable text, removing stop words, and lastly lemmatize it. After cleaning the text data I vectorize my bag of words.

## Random Forest Classification
Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression, and other tasks that operate by constructing a   multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean/average prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

After trying a few models for classification like Scoasthic Gradient Descent, logistic regression, I decided to go with Random Forest Classifier. I got almost 60 percent accuracy, but I realized that my model does not make predictions well for pop and rock songs. I  investigated a few misclassifications I found out there are a lot of common words between rock on pop songs. There is conflicting about how people label song genres.

 ## Feature Importance
 Feature importance refers to a class of techniques for assigning scores to input features to a predictive model that indicates the relative importance of each feature when making a prediction.
